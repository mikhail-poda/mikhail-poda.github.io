# Introduction to Language Learning
When embarking on the journey of learning a new language, we encounter several interconnected components that together form a complete language skillset. They should be practiced together.

## Overview
### Foundational Knowledge

### Core Language Skills
- Listening
- Speaking
- Reading
- Writing 

## Vocabulary
Vocabulary learning can be challenging but is essential for language acquisition. It must be approached like athletic training - **practiced daily** rather than occasionally during class.

**Spaced Repetition** means that material is reviewed at gradually increasing intervals. Words or phrases that are difficult to remember are repeated more frequently than those that are easier to recall. Once done with physical flashcards, this method now runs as smartphone apps, enhanced with gamification elements to boost motivation.

I have developed two simple apps for learning Hebrew using different Spaced Repetition methods. The description and comparison between these methods is explained in the [Spaced Repetition Methods](/spaced-repetition-methods.md) article.

Knowing your [Proficiency Levels](/hebrew-proficiency-levels.md) helps you track real progress in your language journey.

## Grammar
Hebrew grammar is quite simple. Some aspects, like the verb system, are more of an interesting feature, while others, such as irregular plurals, are better understood as part of vocabulary.

## Listening and Reading
These two skills are often combined, especially now that most YouTube videos include transcriptions. Below is a list of online resources I use for listening and reading.

[Hebrew Time](https://hebrewtime.squarespace.com/) many episodes about life in Israel

[Piece of Hebrew](https://www.youtube.com/@PieceofHebrew/videos) many episodes about life in Israel

[הדרך הקלה](https://www.youtube.com/@ezway) interesting and intellectual content with simple words

[באים אל הפרופסורים](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTseitlin) with many iterviews and lectures
