# Introduction and Hebrew Learning Resources

When embarking on the journey of learning a new language, we encounter several interconnected components that together form a complete language skillset. They should be practiced together.

## Vocabulary

Vocabulary learning can be challenging but is essential for language acquisition. It must be approached like athletic training - **practiced daily** rather than occasionally during class.

**Spaced Repetition** means that material is reviewed at gradually increasing intervals. Words or phrases that are difficult to remember are repeated more frequently than those that are easier to recall. Once done with physical flashcards, this method now runs as smartphone apps, enhanced with gamification elements to boost motivation.

I have developed two simple apps for learning Hebrew using different Spaced Repetition methods. The description and comparison between these methods is explained in the [Spaced Repetition Methods](/lang/spaced-repetition-methods.md) article.

Knowing your [Proficiency Level](/lang/hebrew-proficiency-levels.md) helps you track progress in your language journey.

## Grammar

Hebrew grammar is quite simple. Some aspects, like the verb system, are more of an interesting feature, while others, such as irregular plurals, are better treated as part of vocabulary.

## Listening and Reading

These two skills are often combined, especially now that most YouTube videos include transcriptions. [Here](/lang/learning-resources.md) is a list of online resources I use for listening and reading.
