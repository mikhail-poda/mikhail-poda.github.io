## "Water" words with ט

The letter **ט (Tet)** is one of the less commonly used letters in Hebrew, but interestingly, many words related to **water** and **purity** include this letter. While it may just be a coincidence, it's a fun pattern to notice. I once heard a Hebrew teacher refer to **ט** as *"a wet letter"* 😊

| **Hebrew** | **Meaning** |
|------------|-------------|
| **טוֹב**    | good        |
| **טֶבַע**    | nature      |
| **טָרִי**    | fresh       |
| **טָעִים**   | tasty       |
| **טַל**     | dew         |
| **טיפה**   | drop        |
| **טָהוֹר**   | pure        |
| **רָטוֹב**   | wet         |
| **מָטָר**    | rain, shower     |
| **טִפְטוּף**  | slow water drops |
| **לְשַׁייֵּט**  | to sail        |
| **לִשְׁטוֹף**  | to wash, rinse |
| **לְהַטְבִּיעַ** | to drown, sink |

## The Letter פ and Verbs of Splitting, Spreading, and Separating

Another curious pattern in Hebrew is the frequent appearance of the letter **פ (Pe)** in verbs that involve **multiple parts, breaking or spreading**. Verbs with a less obvious connection, like **לפצוע** (to wound), are linked by their root to a rarely used verb **להפציע** (to pierce, break through)".
