## Surprising Parallels in Grammar

Although Hebrew is a Semitic language and very different in origin from Indo-European tongues,
it has some features that look strikingly familiar compared with other languages.

### The Infinitive – like English

Hebrew not only has the same concept of the infinitive, but it is even formed in the same way as in English:
by adding the particle **to**/**ל־** at the front. Just as English uses **to + eat** Hebrew uses **ל + אכול** (*le’ekhol* – to eat).

In Modern Hebrew, the verb form without **ל־** (the infinitive absolute) still exists, but it is rarely used.

### Present Tense – like in Russian

Hebrew and Russian verb conjugations are usually complex,
with special forms for person and number (and in Hebrew also for gender).
Surprisingly, **present tense in Hebrew** and **past tense in Russian** are much simpler, 
and are built using the same technique.

In both cases, these tenses are expressed using **participial forms** (verbal adjectives) in Hebrew and
**archaic participles** in Russian, both agreeing with the subject in gender and number only (and not in person).

* Hebrew: **קוֹרֵא** (*kore*) – I/you/he is reading (m.sg.)
* Russian: **читал** (*chital*) – I/you/he was reading (m.sg.)

### Vowels to Shift Verbs – like in German

Although German has no such system like Hebrew **binyanim**,
it possesses a small set of common verbs that also shift meaning through vowel alternation.
Some of these pairs are **transitive–intransitive** (state vs. cause), others show
**shifted but related meanings**, like in Hebrew:

* **sitzen** (to sit) ↔ **setzen** (to set, seat)
* **liegen** (to lie) ↔ **legen** (to lay)
* **fordern** (to demand) ↔ **fördern** (to promote, support)
* **drucken** (to print) ↔ **drücken** (to press)

### Inverted Liking

The English expression **I like him** follows the standard pattern: the one who likes (**I**) is the subject.
Surprisingly, in **Hebrew, Italian, German, and Russian**, the construction is reversed:
the **liked person is the subject**, and the one who likes is expressed indirectly:

* Hebrew: **הוא מוצא חן בעיניי** – *he finds grace in my eyes*
* Italian: **lui mi piace** – *he pleases me*
* German: **er gefällt mir** – *he pleases me*
* Russian: **он мне нравится** – *he is pleasing to me*

### Time Facing the Wrong Way

One interesting feature that Hebrew shares with several European languages is the way it links **time** and **space**.
Across these languages, the same metaphor repeats: **front = earlier** and **behind = later**.

| **Root**          | **Spatial Meaning** | **Temporal Meaning** | **Spatial Examples**                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ק־ד־מ**        | front, east         | before, previous     | **קָדִימָה** (*kadima*) – forward<br>**מוּקְדָּם** (*mukdam*) – early<br>**הַקּוֹדֵם** (*hakodem*) – the previous one<br>**קֶדֶם** (*kedem*) – antiquity, east |
| **א־ח־ר**        | behind, backwards   | after, later         | **אָחוֹרָה** (*ahora*) – backward<br>**מְאוּחָר** (*meuchar*) – late<br>**אַחֲרוֹן** (*aharon*) – last, final<br>**אַחֲרֵי** (*acharei*) – after               |

* In English, *before* is both “in front of” and “earlier,” while *after* is “behind / later.”
* In German, *vor* means “in front of / before,” and *nach* means “behind / after.”
* In Russian, *перед* (*pered*) is “in front of / before,” while *после* (*posle*) is “after.”
* In Italian, the connection is weaker: *prima* and *dopo* are only temporal, while *davanti* and *dietro* are only spatial.

## "Water" Words with ט

The letter **ט (Tet)** is one of the less commonly used letters in Hebrew,
but interestingly, many words related to **water** and **purity** include this letter.
While it may just be a coincidence, it's a fun pattern to notice.
I once heard a Hebrew teacher refer to **ט** as *"a wet letter"* 😊

| **טוֹב**    | good        |
