## Surprising Parallels in Grammar

Although Hebrew is a Semitic language and very different in origin from Indo-European tongues,
it has some features that look strikingly familiar compared with other languages.

### The Infinitive – like English

Hebrew not only has the same concept of the infinitive, but it is even formed in the same way as in English:
by adding the particle **to**/**ל־** at the front. Just as English uses **to + eat** Hebrew uses **ל + אכול** (*le’ekhol* – to eat).

In Modern Hebrew, the verb form without **ל־** (the infinitive absolute) still exists, but it is rarely used.

### Present Tense – like in Russian

Hebrew and Russian verb conjugations are usually complex,
with special forms for person and number (and in Hebrew also for gender).
Surprisingly, **present tense in Hebrew** and **past tense in Russian** are much simpler, 
and are built using the same technique.

In both cases, these tenses are expressed using **participial forms** (verbal adjectives) in Hebrew and
**archaic participles** in Russian, both agreeing with the subject in gender and number only (and not in person).

* Hebrew: **קוֹרֵא** (*kore*) – I/you/he is reading (m.sg.)
* Russian: **читал** (*chital*) – I/you/he was reading (m.sg.)

### Vowels to Shift Verbs – like in German

Although German has no such system like Hebrew **binyanim**,
it possesses a small set of common verbs that also shift meaning through vowel alternation.
Some of these pairs are **transitive–intransitive** (state vs. cause), others show
**shifted but related meanings**, like in Hebrew:

* **sitzen** (to sit) ↔ **setzen** (to set, seat)
* **liegen** (to lie) ↔ **legen** (to lay)
* **fordern** (to demand) ↔ **fördern** (to promote, support)
* **drucken** (to print) ↔ **drücken** (to press)

### Inverted Liking

The English expression **I like him** follows the standard pattern: the one who likes (**I**) is the subject.
Surprisingly, in **Hebrew, Italian, German, and Russian**, the construction is reversed:
the **liked person is the subject**, and the one who likes is expressed indirectly:

* Hebrew: **הוא מוצא חן בעיניי** – *he finds grace in my eyes*
* Italian: **lui mi piace** – *he pleases me*
* German: **er gefällt mir** – *he pleases me*
* Russian: **он мне нравится** – *he is pleasing to me*

## "Water" Words with ט

The letter **ט (Tet)** is one of the less commonly used letters in Hebrew,
but interestingly, many words related to **water** and **purity** include this letter.
While it may just be a coincidence, it's a fun pattern to notice.
I once heard a Hebrew teacher referring to **ט** as *"a wet letter"* 💧.

| **Hebrew** | **Meaning** |
|------------|-------------|
| **טוֹב**    | good        |
| **טֶבַע**    | nature      |
| **טָרִי**    | fresh       |
| **טָעִים**   | tasty       |
| **טַל**     | dew         |
| **טיפה**   | drop        |
| **טָהוֹר**   | pure        |
| **רָטוֹב**   | wet         |
| **מָטָר**    | rain, shower     |
| **טִפְטוּף**  | slow water drops |
| **לְשַׁייֵּט**  | to sail        |
| **לִשְׁטוֹף**  | to wash, rinse |
| **לְהַטְבִּיעַ** | to drown, sink |

## The Letter פ and Verbs of Splitting, Spreading, and Separating

A curious pattern in Hebrew is the appearance of the letter **פ (Pe)**
as the first root letter in many verbs that belong to the semantic field of 
**breaking, separating, or spreading into multiple parts**, see [the whole list here](/verb/split-spread.md).

* When **פ** is not the first root letter, but appears second, it follows either **נ (Nun)** or **שׁ (Shin)**
* More then the half of these roots contain also **ר (Resh)** as its second or third consonant.
* The only exception to this rule is the root **ח־ל־ק** – to share, divide.
* The verb **לִשְׁבּוֹר** - to break is not really exceptional because **בּ** sounds like **פ**.
* Many English words in this same semantic field also form a recognizable pattern, typically starting with **s** and containing both **p** and **r**.
* This semantic field is closely related to a semantic fild with the meaning **to open** which also starts with **פ (Pe)**.
