# Introduction to Language Learning
When embarking on the journey of learning a new language, we encounter several interconnected components that together form a complete language skillset. They should be practiced together

### Core Language Skills

## Vocabulary
Vocabulary learning can be challenging but is essential for language acquisition. It must be approached like athletic training - **practiced daily** rather than occasionally during class.

**Spaced Repetition** means that material is reviewed at gradually increasing intervals. Words or phrases that are difficult to remember are repeated more frequently than those that are easier to recall. While traditionally done with physical flashcards, modern apps now facilitate this process. I have developed two simple apps for learning Hebrew using different Spaced Repetition methods. The description and comparison between these methods is explained in the [Spaced Repetition Methods](/spaced-repetition-methods.md) article.

Knowing your [Proficiency Levels](/hebrew-proficiency-levels.md) helps you track real progress in your language journey.
