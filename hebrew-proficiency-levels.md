### **Comparison of Ulpan Levels & CEFR**

The Hebrew **Ulpan levels (Aleph, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Hey, Vav)** donâ€™t perfectly match the **CEFR (A1â€“C2)** system, but they roughly correspond as follows:  

| **CEFR Level** | **Ulpan Level** | **New Vocab.** |**Total Vocab.** | **Features** |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **A0 (Absolute Beginner)** | Pre-Aleph | 50 |  50 | no verbs |
| **A1 (Beginner)** | Aleph | 400 | 400 | only paal present |
| **A2 (Elementary)** | Aleph+ / Bet 1 | 800 | 1,200 | past tense |  
| **B1 (Lower Intermediate)** | Bet 2 / Gimel 1 | 1,200 | 2,400 | future tense |
| **B2 (Upper Intermediate)** | Gimel 2 / Dalet | 1,600 | 4,000 | passive verbs |

| **C2 (Proficient/Near-Native)** | Vav | 3,000+ | 9,000 | literary language | 

Great question! The **proportion of vocabulary by part of speech** varies by language level and usage, but in Hebrew, a general breakdown looks like this:
